# Week-7
This is my Week 7 programming assignment for C++ class. The program helps users track their souvenir collecting hobby. Users can add souvenirs, view a formatted summary, calculate totals and averages, save data to a file, and get recommendations on their collecting level.

The program demonstrates key concepts from the first 8 chapters of the textbook, including:

- Structs

- Arrays of structs

- Enums

- Input validation

- Loops (for, while, do-while)

- Switch menu

- File output

- Formatted console output


 Features Implemented

- Add Souvenirs: Collect name, type, quantity, and price; calculate total cost.

- Struct & Array: Stores multiple souvenir entries in an array of structs.

- Enum: SouvenirType ensures consistent souvenir type selection.

- Validation: Prevents invalid input (empty names, negative numbers).

- Menu: Switch-based menu with 4 options: Add souvenir, View file report, Array summary, Recommend collecting level.

-Loops:

- For loop: Add multiple souvenirs

- While loop: Calculate totals/averages for array summary

- Do-while loop: Repeat menu until user quits

- File Output: Saves souvenir data to report.txt

- Formatted Console Output: Uses setw and alignment for neat tables


Notes:

- The program supports up to 50 souvenir entries using an array.

- Data is saved to report.txt for persistent tracking.

- The program demonstrates proper use of arrays of structs in the debugger, as required by the professor.
